This GitHub repository contains the Asymmetrik Programming Challenge (1) Business Card OCR. This program takes a .txt file of a business card as the input, and parses the information to return the Name, Phone, and Email Address. This project is written in Java.

The program can be compiled and ran in the command line as so:
javac BusinessCardParser.java
java BusinessCardParser your-business-card.txt

BusinessCardParser.java must be in the same directory as ContactInfo.java

I have attached an image of my Terminal showing the correct results of all three examples given by Asymmetrik. I also tried my examples. Feel free to test the robustness of my program by testing your own business card txt files. 

Note: This is my own original work. However, my solution required a txt file of most common English first names. I downloaded this file from GitHub user dominictarr. I am not claiming this txt file as my own compilation.
